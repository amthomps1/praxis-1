# Praxis Program Charter

While each cohort of students will assemble their own charter that expresses their particular goals and values, we intend this document to serve as a foundation for all their work. This document represents a contract between our students and the Scholars' Lab, an expression of our core values, pedagogy, and goals. Cohort-specific charters written by the students themselves can be found on our [charter archive](/charter). 

## Success

We take a flexible approach to success in the Praxis Program. Failure is a virtue. Mistakes are the portals for discovery. Learning from failure is more important than succeeding uncritically. So long as they are reflecting and learning, we will be pleased with our students. All the same, we have certain parameters for our own success as stewards of the Praxis Program. Based on this document, by the end of the year, we hope our students will:

* become more familiar with a variety of digital humanities technologies and the intellectual stakes of working with them;
* become capable of pursuing their own research interests as they pertain to digital humanities;
* see digital humanities as a field available to them regardless of their background;
* know where to go for help and to learn further;
* come to see themselves as experts in digital research with experiences worthy of sharing with others as scholars and teachers;
* and prepare themselves to pay it forward, early and often.

## Professionalization

The program aims to put students out in the world acting as professional scholar-practitioners from day one. The outcomes for any given year might change, but we typically ask for some combination of the following activities from our students during the year as markers of this professionalization:

* Regular blog posts on the process
* Conference or journal submissions based on the cohort's work
* Workshop presentations, locally or regionally
* Digital project
* Web presence for the cohort's work
* Final presentation to a local audience

## The Personal

To collaborate well we must first re-examine ourselves, the work we do and how we do it. The Praxis Program, at its best, empowers students to explore new interests that they might have previously thought themselves unable to try. This is a space to stretch and fail, to grow and discover. We all bring something to the table, and our year together is an invitation to our students themselves differently.

## The Interpersonal

The ways we interact with each other matter, and the Praxis Program offers a space for us to think about how we move back and forth between the needs of a group and what we can bring to it. We measure success by the work we do to enable those around us, and we want our students to think in similar terms. This means engaging in hard conversations about the biases and privileges we all bring to the table. We actively work to become better interlocutors, collaborators, and allies, to re-examine how we interact with others differently and work to do so more productively.

## This Is Not a Course

While we might meet around a table and talk, this is fundamentally not a seminar. The work that our students do will be different, and the way we go about that work will be different than in a normal class. Students might note these differences in particular:

* We value listening over talking.
* We care more about shaping something new than deconstructing something before us.
* Given the choice between giving and taking, we choose the former every time.
* We read. We talk. But we also do.
* Our work lives in public, beyond the walls of the classroom.
* Process is more important than product.

## Careers and Imagined Futures

The Praxis Program is meant to expose students to a variety of careers within the academy, within libraries, and with digital humanities. Interstitial careers like those held by the Scholars' Lab staff are viable options for many graduate students, but visibility is a first barrier to to taking initial steps in those directions. Beyond developing the skills necessary to head down one of these career paths, then, the Praxis Program is meant to put students in touch with staff whose career and professional trajectories can serve as examples. We actively offer advice to students who might be interested in such careers themselves.

## Stewardship

As stewards of the Praxis Program, the Scholars' Lab takes responsibility for the pedagogical experience of all of its students. We are committed to providing a safe space in which our students can learn and grow. To this end, we will constantly re-evaluate the curriculum with an eye to building the best experience for the students. On a more interpersonal level: collaboration can be difficult, and sometimes things go wrong. In these cases the Scholars' Lab will intervene, either privately or with the group at large. While we will keep an eye out for such a need, students are free to request such intervention at anytime. Such interventions might include but are not limited to: renegotiating roles, private discussions of behavior and team responsibilities, or removal from the team. 

In addition, we will endeavour, within reason, to act as stewards of the digital projects produced by our students. Technologies change, however, and this might mean different things for different projects: minimal support in some cases, migration to new technologies or platforms in others, or, most likely, retiring projects whose technologies have grown unsupportable. In all cases we will do our best to maintain legible evidence of the scope, process, and intervention made by the project, even if the project itself is no longer maintainable. 

What does all this mean on a day-to-day level? Well, it changes every year depending on how things have been going, the staff involved, and the particular cohort of students for that year. Check out the [curriculum page](/curriculum)
