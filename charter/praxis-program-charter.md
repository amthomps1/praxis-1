# Praxis Program Charter

## Praxis Program Specifically

While each cohort of students will assemble their own document that expresses their particular goals and values, we intend this document to serve as a foundation for all their work. It represents a contract between us and our students. 


### Professionalization

The program aims to put students out in the world acting as professional scholar-practitioners from day one. The outcomes for any given year might change, but we typically encourage the following:

* Final presentation to a local audience
* Conference or journal submissions based on individual and group work undertaken during the year
* Workshop opportunities


### Stewardship

As stewards of the Praxis program, the Scholars' Lab takes responsibility for the pedagogical experience of all of its students. We are committed to providing a safe space in which our students can learn and grow. To this end, we will constantly re-evaluate the curriculum with an eye to building the best experience for the students. On a more interpersonal level: collaboration can be difficult, and sometimes things go wrong. In these cases the Scholars' Lab will intervene, either privately or with the group at large. While we will keep an eye out for such a need, students are free to request such intervention at anytime. Such interventions might include but are not limited to: renegotiating roles, private discussions of behavior and team responsibilities, or removal from the team.

### Careers and Imagined Futures

The Praxis Program is meant to expose students to a variety of careers within the academy, within libraries, and with digital humanities. Interstitial careers like those held by the Scholars' Lab staff are viable options for many graduate students, but visibility is a first barrier to to taking initial steps in those directions. Beyond developing the skills necessary to begin one these careers, then, the Praxis Program is meant to put students in touch with staff whose career and professional trajectories can serve as examples. And these same staff can offer advice for students interested in such careers themselves.


### This is not a course

While we might meet around a seminar table and talk, this is fundamentally not a seminar. The work that our students do will be different, and the way we go about that work will be different than that in a normal class. Students might note these differences in particular:

* We value listening over talking.
* We care more about shaping something new than deconstructing something on the table.
* Given the choice between giving over taking, we choose the former every time.

### The ways we interact with each other matter.

* Think about the biases and privileges we all bring to the table.
* Success is measured by the work you do to enable those around you.

### Re-examine yourselves

See themselves differently
See others differently

* Public engagement 
* Personal development


### Success
Failure is a virtue. Mistakes are the portals for discovery. Learning from failure is more important than succeeding uncritically. So long as they are reflecting and learning, we will be pleased with our students.

* Students will be more familiar with technology and the intellectual stakes of working with it.


What does all this mean on a day-to-day level? Well, it changes every year depending on how things have been going, the staff involved, and the particular cohort of students for that year. Check out the [curriculum page](/curriculum)

### Frustration is to be expected, but we care

Students are teachers

The students are the project
Do more with less.
