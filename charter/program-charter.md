# Praxis Program Charter

While each cohort of students will assemble their own document that expresses their particular goals and values, we intend this document to serve as a foundation for all their work. It represents a contract between us and our students.

### Trust

We trust in students, in their ability to excel, to master material, and to make intellectual contributions early, often, and at a professional level when given the chance.

### Care 

We teach the whole person, that the personal difficulties and successes of a student can not be separated from their professional development. 

### With

Our students get their hands dirty. We do the work with you - not for you. Our ideal classroom is one in which the students

### Hacking / Yacking / Stacking
Doing is inseparable from thinking. Technical decisions are intellectual ones and vice versa. And all of our conversations and actions are informed by institutional structures that inform the work we do. Our students will engage in all three areas.

### Ownership

We want our students to own their work intellectually and technically. They should understand the technical decisions made during their work with us. 

### This is not a course

While we might meet around a seminar table and talk, this is fundamentally not a seminar. The work that our students do will be different, and the way we go about that work will be different than that in a normal class. Students might note these differences in particular:

* We value listening over talking.
* We care more about shaping something new than deconstructing something on the table.
* Given the choice between giving over taking, we choose the former every time.

### We all have imposter syndrome

We typically work with humanists who have a wide variety of technical and personal experiences, some more or less than others. We believe this work should be available based on interest-not background. Our success is measured by our ability to bring along the person struggling the most. 

### We are working on it and talk actively about that work.

We talk openly about our pedagogical process. When possible, we write about it as well. If something is not working, we will change it and adapt based on the needs of the students and our colleagues. Accordingly, we expect our students to talk and write about the learning process for them, to engage in the experience, and help us shape a pedagogical experience that works for them.

We fully endorse the values expressed in the Collaborator's Bill of Rights and, in particular, the [Student Collaborator's Bill of Rights](http://cdh.ucla.edu/news/a-student-collaborators-bill-of-rights/).

### The ways we interact with each other matter.

* Think about the biases and privileges we all bring to the table.
* Success is measured by the work you do to enable those around you.

### We work in public

We believe in the value of working in public. Most typically this takes the form of regular blogging, so that 
gets you what? How can we show them what they get out of it?

### Frustration is to be expected, but we care

### Success
Failure is a virtue. Mistakes are the portals for discovery. Learning from failure is more important than succeeding uncritically. So long as they are reflecting and learning, we will be pleased with our students.
* Students will be more familiar with technology and the intellectual stakes of working with it.

alt-ac outcomes

* Public reflections on failure make equal intellectual contributions

### Re-examine yourselves

See themselves differently
See others differently
* Public engagement 
* Personal development

### Skills
The program is meant to position itself as an intervention into graduate training, to provide a curriculum for scholar-practitioners to develop familiarity with the kinds of skills and methods. Typically these include but are not limited to:

* Critical awareness of the different parts of the field
* Social interactions with the students
* What do we want you to get out of this
* Reshaping their sense of careers that are possible
* Intellectual engagement

Students are teachers
Students should be paid.

The students are the project
Do more with less. 

### Social justice

### Professionalization

The program aims to put students out in the world acting as professional scholar-practitioners from day one. The outcomes for any given year might change, but we typically encourage the following:

* Final presentation to a local audience
* Conference or journal submissions based on individual and group work undertaken during the year
* Workshop opportunities

### Stewardship

As stewards of the Praxis program, the Scholars' Lab takes responsibility for the pedagogical experience of all of its students. We are committed to providing a safe space in which our students can learn and grow. To this end, we will constantly re-evaluate the curriculum with an eye to building the best experience for the students. On a more interpersonal level: collaboration can be difficult, and sometimes things go wrong. In these cases the Scholars' Lab will intervene, either privately or with the group at large. While we will keep an eye out for such a need, students are free to request such intervention at anytime. Such interventions might include but are not limited to: renegotiating roles, private discussions of behavior and team responsibilities, or removal from the team.
