# Praxis Schedule 2020-2021

Praxis meets officially for three hours once a week during the academic year. The following schedule represents a projection of what the content of those weekly meetings will be. Each session is projected to be roughly 60-120 minutes long, which will allow plenty of time for flexibility and conversation with the group before and after.

Meetings will be the Scholars' Lab fellows lounge. In general, Praxis will follow the schedule of the academic calendar. So first meetings will be the first week of classes, we will observe holidays and reading days, and we'll end each semester the last week of classes.

Code lab curriculum - [https://github.com/scholarslab/CodeLab](https://github.com/scholarslab/CodeLab)

Slides -

* [Introduction to Praxis](/assets/orientation-and-praxis.pptx)
* [Workshop on Workshops](/assets/workshop-on-workshops/workshop-on-workshops.pptx)
  * [Accompanying Sentiment Analysis Passages](/assets/workshop-on-workshops/sentiment-analysis-passages.docx)

### Fall - 15 weeks - August 25 - December 10

Our standard time together is generally going to be Tuesdays from 1-2 EST and Thursdays from 1-3 EST, with 2-3 being Codelab. We'll be on zoom at least for the fall.

Three assignments - charter, workshop, grant/project proposal.
Goal is to have them develop a portfolio of things at the end of the year both individually and as a group.

* Week 1
  * Tuesday, August 25th from 1-2
    * "Praxis - or, what you're in for," Brandon;
    * Framing of charter assignment, Brandon
    * Readings assigned
      * [Scholars’ Lab charter](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/charter/)
      * [Scholars’ Lab student program charter](http://scholarslab.org/student-programs-charter/)
      * [Praxis Program charter](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/charter/) - (overlaps a lot with the previous one, so I’d just look for the different bits)
      * [A Digital Boot Camp for Grad Students in the Humanities](https://www.chronicle.com/article/A-Digital-Boot-Camp-for-Grad/131665/) by former SLab director Bethany Nowviskie
  * Thursday, August 27th from 1-2
    * Conversation about Collaboration and Community, Brandon and Amanda **Booked**
  * Thursday, August 27th from 2-3
    * [Code lab](https://github.com/scholarslab/codelab) - pep talk
    * Readings assigned (optional):
      * [Paul Ford, What is Code?](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/)
      * [Benjamin Schmidt, Do Digital Humanists Need to Understand Algorithms?](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/557c453b-4abb-48ce-8c38-a77e24d3f0bd#ch48) - Don't get caught up in the technical details; there's absolutely no need to understand a Fourier Transform in any depth. 
      * [Ian Milligan and James Baker, Introduction to the Bash Command Line](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash) - All of you are using MacOS (or Linux), so this should be fairly straightforward. If you've switched to a Windows (or other) machine, please let me know because that could be a bit messier. 
* Week 2
  * Tuesday, September 1 from 1-2
    * Intro to Charters, Ronda **Booked**
    * Readings Assigned
      * Other Praxis cohort charters, available on the Praxis site - [http://praxis.scholarslab.org/charter/](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/charter/). Explore to your heart’s content, but they repeat each other a fair amount. So no need to go overboard - I might pick one or two.
      * And then, if you have time, you might check out one or two of the resources here - [http://praxis.scholarslab.org/resources/toward-a-project-charter/](http://praxis.scholarslab.org/resources/toward-a-project-charter/). Those are all related to charter development and very worthwhile. Explore at your interest, but the Collaborators’ Bill of Rights and Bethany’s piece are probably the most widely cited.
