# Praxis Schedule 2017-2018

Praxis meets officially for two hours once a week during the academic year. The following schedule represents a projection of what the content of those weekly meetings will be. Each session is projected to be roughly 60 minutes long, which will allow plenty of time for flexibility and conversation with the group before and after.

This year we broke out the technical components into a third hour at the suggestion of Zoe. This coding track ran concurrently throughout the year, and the extra contact hour gave us a chance to go further with the students.
