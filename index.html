      <p>In observation of the <a href="https://copyright.library.virginia.edu/public-domain/">expansion of the public domain in 2019</a>, our project examines how U.S. copyright law interacts with digital research and pedagogy. Working with <i>Robert Frostâ€™s New Hampshire</i> (1923), we will present a series of tutorials that demonstrate how to use a public domain work in order to empower our audience to understand, transform, and intervene in the range of material now available online. </p>

    <p>The Praxis Program reimagines graduate methodological training for the demands of the humanities in the digital age.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to equip knowledge workers for positions within and beyond the academy at a moment in which new questions can be asked and new systems built. The Praxis Program produces humanities scholars who can reach new audiences and are as comfortable writing code as they are managing teams and budgets.</p>
