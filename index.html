      <h1>Unclosure</h1>
      <p>In observation of the <a href="https://copyright.library.virginia.edu/public-domain/">expansion of the public domain in 2019</a>, <i>Unclosure: An Act for the Encouragement of Learning</i> examines how U.S. copyright law interacts with digital research and pedagogy. Working with Robert Frostâ€™s New Hampshire (1923), the project presents a series of tutorials that demonstrate how to use a public domain work in order to empower our audience to understand, transform, and intervene in the range of material now available online. Find out more at the <a href="http://unclosure.scholarslab.org">project site</a>.</p>

    <p>The Praxis Program reimagines graduate methodological training for the demands of the humanities in the digital age.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to equip knowledge workers for positions within and beyond the academy at a moment in which new questions can be asked and new systems built. The Praxis Program produces humanities scholars who can reach new audiences and are as comfortable writing code as they are managing teams and budgets.</p>
