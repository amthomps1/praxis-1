      <h1>Title TBD!</h1>
      <p>Building on the work of the <a href="https://equityatlas.lib.virginia.edu/">Charlottesville Regional Equity Atlas</a>, our project investigates the University of Virginia’s and <a href="https://www.uvafoundation.com/">UVA Foundation</a>’s land development and expansion throughout Charlottesville and Albemarle County since the 1980s. In light of UVA’s 2030 plan to be “Great and Good,” we will examine how these developments have affected local communities, and place these impacts in dialogue with UVA’s public narratives.</p>

<div id="pitch">
    <p>The Praxis Program reimagines graduate methodological training for the demands of the humanities in the digital age.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to equip knowledge workers for positions within and beyond the academy at a moment in which new questions can be asked and new systems built. The Praxis Program produces humanities scholars who can reach new audiences and are as comfortable writing code as they are managing teams and budgets.</p>
