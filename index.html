      <h1>Augmenting the University</h1>
      <p>The 2017-2018 Praxis cohort is moving the material history of UVA
       out of Special Collections and onto Grounds.
       Using mobile Artifical Reality applications, Augmenting the University explores
       otherwise hidden stories, histories, and questions
       surrounding objects and spaces at UVA. 
       In doing so, we hope to prompt users to re-examine everyday environs and
       critically reflect on the structure, culture, mission, and history of the university.</p>

    <h1>Time tracking and JavaScript</h1>
    <p>What are we working on? This week we are continuing to work on JavaScript, learning on our own and also with the help of the folks at the SLab. We are also finishing our experiential time reflections, each of us running our own experiment on how we value and structure our time in our daily lives. You can check out our memos/posts for more details on what everyone is up to - we should have some final reflective thoughts on it up next week.

    <p>The Praxis Program reimagines graduate methodological training for the demands of the humanities in the digital age.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to equip knowledge workers for positions within and beyond the academy at a moment in which new questions can be asked and new systems built. The Praxis Program produces humanities scholars who can reach new audiences and are as comfortable writing code as they are managing teams and budgets.</p>
